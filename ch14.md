# Chapter 14- A Brief Survey of the Linux Desktop
  One of the great things about Linux is the creative control given to the users. This includes how your desktop looks and feels.
  Linux provides many options for desktop environments. Many distributions come with a default window environment.
  That can be changed easily by the user. There are currently two distributions that I am actively using, Arch Linux and Ubuntu.
  I decided to change the desktop environment for Ubuntu since I am satisfied with my Arch Linux setup.
  For my Arch distro I already manually configured KDE plasma.
  Ubuntu default was Unity and though Gnome is not a huge difference I decided to give it a test drive, even if just momentarily. 
  Through the command line this is how I accomplished my goal.

## Commands 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnome-shell

### Final steps
After completing these commands, I logged out. After logging back in I now had two options and I choose my new Gnome desktop environment.
I look forward to testing others as this experience is just a step in finding my true comfort GUI.
