# Chapter 15 Development Tools
This chapter introduces C Programming and the C Compiler and their uses within Linux. 
There were some interesting things that I wish to learn in the chapter. 
Linking programs against shared libraries and using the command-line arguments and options along with programming.
Towards the end of the chapter the book also introduces other programming languages that could be useful along with Linux.
For this assignment though I concentrated on C Programming and compiled a C program for the first time since Mary’s class.
I wasn’t as rusty as expected. Not quite like riding a bike but some of the knowledge was definitely retained. 
In fact the C Compiler was still installed in my old rig. I didn’t want to push myself too hard so I made a very simple program.
I also skipped a few necessary characters needed to run the program because I wasn't sure if it would interfere with the Markdown language.

## C Program Instructions

main()

printf(“Justing getting going with C again”);

printf(“ hope it goes well!\n”);

return 0;

### Conclusion
I omitted some brackets and the fact that the file was named .c after the file name. Sometimes I forget how powerful of a tool programming knowledge can bring. I want to get more competant in this area, probably should have tried a more complex program. The journey continues.
